Node.js
Node.js is a runtime environment for JavaScript. Originally, JavaScript could only run inside a web browser. Node.js allows JavaScript to run on a local machine or a server. It was created by Ryan Dahl (using Google’s V8 engine).

History of JavaScript
JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich at Netscape, not Google. However, Google created the V8 engine, which is the technology that makes JavaScript run very fast today.

Applications of JavaScript
You can use JavaScript to build:

Web Apps (Frontend and Backend)

Mobile Apps

Games

Machine Learning (ML)

Internet of Things (IoT)

Single-Threaded vs. Multi-Threaded
JavaScript is a single-threaded language.

The Restaurant Analogy:

JavaScript: Imagine a restaurant with many tables but only one worker. One person might struggle to serve everyone at once. To solve this, JavaScript uses a concept called Asynchronous programming. This allows the worker to take an order, move to the next table while the food is cooking, and come back when the meal is ready.

Java: This is like a restaurant with multiple workers (multi-threaded). Each worker can handle a different table at the same time.

The Learning Journey
Learning a programming language is like the human life cycle:

Birth (Installation): Setting up the environment.

Naming (Variables): Giving names to values.

Family (Data Types): Learning the different types of information (Strings, Numbers, etc.).

Comparison (Operators): Learning how to compare things (Who is bigger? Are they equal?).

Good vs. Bad (Conditions): Using "If/Else" logic to make decisions.

Repetition (Loops): Doing the same task over and over.

Reusing (Functions): Learning how to package a task so you can do it again easily.

Interaction (OOP): Learning how objects interact with the real world.

Mistakes (Exception Handling): Learning how to deal with errors when things go wrong.
